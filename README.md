config.php
==

The config.php file is not included as part of the repository to maintain the security of the database.
This is what the config.php file looks like without any options actually defined.
```php
<?php
define('SERVER_IP', '');
define('SERVER_USER', '');
define('SERVER_PASS', '');
define('VERIFY_CODE', '');
?>
```

Just put that in a file called config.php in the same directory as index.php, put in the configuration you need and go!
